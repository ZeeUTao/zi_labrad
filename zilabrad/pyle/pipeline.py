Pipelining

The goal of pipelining is to run several operations in parallel
when each operation can take multiple steps.  For datataking, the
steps are typically something like (1) run sequence on the DACs,
(2) process the returned data, (3) save to the data vault.  In the
past, most of our pipelining tools have taken the approach of
assuming (and hence enforcing) this basic structure, which limits
what one can do.  Here, we take a more generic approach, by requiring
only that each process is provided as a python generator.

To enable parallelism with pipelining, functions should return a Future,
which is basically an object that knows how to wait for the result of
some computation that may take a long time, a sort of promise to get a
result in the future.  When you make a Labrad request with the option
wait=False, for example, the result is a Future.  The call returns
immediately and you can go do other things.  When you want the result,
you call .wait() and only then does the system wait for the answer.
So the simplest way to enable parallelism is to write functions that
make Labrad requests with wait=False and return.

In addition, you can use generators that yield Future's for more
complicated work, where for example you need to looping, conditionals,
or postprocessing, and you want this to continue to work with pipelining.

    The interface to this function is similar to the builtin map function,
    however the name has been changed so as not to overwrite the builtin name,
    and to highlight an important difference with the builtin function.
    Unlike the builtin python map function, pmap returns not a list of results,
    but rather an iterator that produces the results, somewhat like itertools.imap.
    So, in order to ensure that the mapping actually happens, you must 'exhaust'
    the resulting iterator, for example by collecting it into a list or
    iterating over it in a for loop.
