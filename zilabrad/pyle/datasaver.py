class Dataset(object):
    """Encapsulates a dataset that is created and written to via the data vault.
    
    If no connection is provided, a new one will be created.  Whether a new
    connection is established or not, all communication happens in our own
    private context, so that we will not interfere with other communication
    happening with datasets in other contexts.
    
    As data are added to the dataset, requests are fired and buffered, but not
    waited for, so as not to block program execution.  Once a certain number
    of requests have been fired (as set by the delay parameter), adding more
    data will cause the oldest request to be popped out of the buffer and waited
    for.  When the disconnect method is called, all remaining requests will be
    popped and waited for, ensuring that the data are fully saved.
    
    This object is compatible with the context management protocol used by the
    'with' statement in python, which will call connect at the beginning and
    disconnect at the end, ensuring that all data added during the body of the
    with statement will get saved before program execution continues.
    
    The lazy parameter controls when the dataset is actually created.  If lazy
    is set to True (the default), then the dataset will not be created until
    the first time data are added to the dataset.  Thus if an error occurs
    and no data are ever added, we do not even create a dataset, which should
    reduce the number of junk empty datasets in the data vault.  Alternately,
    if lazy is set to False, then a dataset will be created immediately when
    connect is called.  Note that in either case, we do not actually wait for
    the result of the creation request until later when the request buffer is
    filled or disconnect is called.
